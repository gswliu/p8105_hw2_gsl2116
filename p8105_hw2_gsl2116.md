PROBLEM 1
---------

``` r
transit_data = select(transit_data, line, station_name, station_latitude, route1:route11, entry, entrance_type, vending, ada)

recode(transit_data$entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)
```

This dataset has 1868 observations and 18 variables (dimensions = 1868 x 18). From the original 32 variables in the dataset, I have only kept 18 that are of interest in my analysis: `select(transit_data, line, station_name, station_latitude, route1:route11, entry, entrance_type, vending, ada)`. This data set includes character, integer, logical, and numeric variable types.

How many distinct stations are there?

How many stations are ADA compliant?

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?
